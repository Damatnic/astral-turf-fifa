   - High contrast for readability (dropdowns now opaque, not transparent)
   - Proper z-index layering (no overlapping elements)
   - Clear visual hierarchy

2. **Intuitive Interactions**
   - Drag-and-drop feels natural (ghost preview, color-coded feedback)
   - Instant actions without confirmation dialogs (unless destructive)
   - Smooth animations (Framer Motion, 60fps maintained)

3. **Responsive Design**
   - View mode toggles (grid/list/compact)
   - Adapts to screen size seamlessly
   - Touch-optimized for mobile

4. **User Feedback**
   - Visual indicators for all states (hover, active, disabled, loading)
   - Color-coded feedback (green=success, red=error, yellow=warning)
   - Informative empty states

5. **Performance**
   - GPU-accelerated animations
   - Optimized renders (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)

- [ ] Adaptive layouts (not just scaled down)

**✅ Performance Checklist**
- [ ] Code splitting (lazy loading)
- [ ] Image optimization (WebP, lazy loading)

### Authentication Flow

**Registration:**
1. User selects role (Coach, Player, Family Member)
2. Fills registration form (email, password, name, etc.)
3. Family members provide player association (needs coach approval)
4. Email verification sent
5. Account created (inactive until email verified)
6. Welcome email with onboarding guide

**Login:**
1. User enters email and password
2. Server validates credentials
3. If valid, generates JWT access token (15min expiry)
4. Generates refresh token (7 days expiry)
5. Returns tokens + user object (with role)
6. Frontend stores tokens (httpOnly cookie + localStorage)
7. User redirected to role-specific dashboard

**Protected Routes:**
1. Frontend checks if user is authenticated
2. Checks if user role has permission for route
3. If not authenticated, redirect to login
4. If authenticated but no permission, redirect to 403 page
5. If authenticated and permitted, render page with role-filtered content

**Token Refresh:**
1. Access token expires after 15 minutes
2. Frontend detects 401 error
3. Sends refresh token to `/api/auth/refresh`
4. Server validates refresh token
5. Issues new access token
6. Retries original request
7. If refresh token expired, logout user

## 🚨 RISKS & MITIGATION

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Backend Development Complexity**
- **Severity:** High
- **Impact:** Could delay entire project
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Start backend development early (Phase 1)
  - Use proven frameworks (NestJS, Express)
  - Set up CI/CD early
  - Comprehensive API testing
  - Fallback: Use Firebase/Supabase for rapid prototyping

**Risk 2: Performance Degradation**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Impact:** Poor user experience
- **Mitigation:**
  - Performance budgets enforced
  - Code splitting from day 1
  - Regular performance audits
  - Lazy loading for all heavy components
  - Database query optimization

**Risk 3: Cross-Browser Compatibility**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Impact:** Users on certain browsers can't access app
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test on all major browsers regularly
  - Polyfills for older browsers
  - Progressive enhancement approach
  - Browser compatibility matrix defined

### Project Management Risks

**Risk 4: Scope Creep**
- **Severity:** High
- **Impact:** Timeline slippage
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strict adherence to phased roadmap
  - Feature freeze after Phase 7
  - Regular scope reviews
  - Backlog for future enhancements

**Risk 5: User Adoption Issues**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Impact:** Low engagement with new features
- **Mitigation:**
  - User testing throughout development
  - Onboarding flows for each role
  - Comprehensive user guides
  - Beta testing with real users
  - Feedback collection and iteration

### Security Risks

**Risk 6: Authentication Vulnerabilities**
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches
- **Mitigation:**
  - Security audit before launch
  - Penetration testing
  - Rate limiting on auth endpoints
  - Strong password policies
  - 2FA implementation (future)
  - Regular security updates
