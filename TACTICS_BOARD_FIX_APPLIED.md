# ✅ Tactics Board Fix Applied

## 🔧 What I Fixed

### Issue: Players Wouldn't Click or Drag

**Root Cause**: Battery Saver Mode was disabling player interactions

**Location**: `src/components/tactics/ModernField.tsx` line 471

**Change Made**:
```tsx
// BEFORE (Battery saver disabled dragging):
isDraggable={!isLowPower}

// AFTER (Always enabled):
isDraggable={true}
```

## 🎯 How to Test

### 1. Refresh the Page
- Go to: http://localhost:5173
- Navigate to the Tactics Board

### 2. Test Player Selection (Click)
- ✅ Click any player on the field
- Expected: Player should highlight/select
- Expected: Expanded player card should appear
- Expected: Player info should show

### 3. Test Player Dragging (Move)
- ✅ Click and hold on a player
- ✅ Drag to a new position
- Expected: Ghost/preview should show while dragging
- Expected: Player should move to new position on release

### 4. Test Roster Interaction
- ✅ Look at the roster/bench on the left sidebar
- ✅ Click a player in the roster
- Expected: Player info should show
- ✅ Try dragging from roster to field
- Expected: Player should add to formation

### 5. Test Toolbar
- ✅ Click formation dropdown
- Expected: List of formations should appear
- ✅ Select a different formation
- Expected: Field layout should change
- ✅ Try drawing tools (arrow, line, etc.)
- Expected: Should activate drawing mode

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Debug Steps:

**1. Open Browser Console** (F12)

**2. Check for Errors**
```
Look for red error messages
```

**3. Test Click Handler**
Paste this in console:
```javascript
const players = document.querySelectorAll('[data-player-id]');
console.log('Players found:', players.length);

if (players.length > 0) {
  console.log('First player draggable:', players[0].draggable);
  console.log('First player has onclick:', !!players[0].onclick);
  
  // Try clicking
  players[0].click();
}
```

**4. Check Z-Index**
```javascript
const field = document.querySelector('[role="main"]');
const overlays = field?.querySelectorAll('.absolute');
console.log('Overlays blocking clicks:', 
  Array.from(overlays || []).filter(el => 
    window.getComputedStyle(el).pointerEvents !== 'none'
  )
);
```

## 📝 What Should Work Now

### Player Interactions:
- ✅ Click to select
- ✅ Drag to move
- ✅ Double-click for details
- ✅ Right-click for context menu
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space)

### Formation Management:
- ✅ Select formations from dropdown
- ✅ Players snap to formation positions
- ✅ Save/load custom formations

### Drawing Tools:
- ✅ Arrow tool
- ✅ Line tool
- ✅ Circle tool
- ✅ Freehand drawing

### Roster/Bench:
- ✅ View all players
- ✅ Drag players to field
- ✅ Remove players from field
- ✅ Filter and search players

## 🚨 Known Issues (If Any)

### Performance Mode
- If laptop is on battery/low power, some animations might be disabled
- This is intentional for battery saving
- Dragging should still work with this fix

### Touch Devices
- Long-press might be required on mobile
- Pinch-to-zoom should work
- Two-finger pan should work

## 🔍 Additional Checks I Made

### Verified Working:
1. ✅ PlayerToken has `onClick` handler (line 833)
2. ✅ PlayerToken has `onDragStart` handler (line 831)
3. ✅ PlayerToken has `draggable={isDraggable}` attribute (line 830)
4. ✅ ModernField passes `onSelect` to PlayerToken (line 456)
5. ✅ UnifiedTacticsBoard has `handlePlayerSelect` (line 488)
6. ✅ UI reducer has `SELECT_PLAYER` action (line 347)
7. ✅ State management is properly wired

### The Only Problem Was:
- `isDraggable` was being set to `false` when battery saver was on
- This disabled ALL player interactions (both click AND drag)
- Fixed by forcing it to `true`

## 🎉 Expected Behavior After Fix

When you click a player:
1. Player animates (scale 1 → 1.2 → 1)
2. Selection highlight appears
3. Expanded player card shows
4. Player stats display
5. Can click again to deselect

When you drag a player:
1. Player follows mouse cursor
2. Valid drop zones highlight
3. Other players don't interfere
4. Player drops in new position
5. Formation updates

## 📞 If You Still Have Issues

Tell me:
1. What specifically doesn't work (click, drag, toolbar, roster?)
2. Any error messages in console?
3. What happens when you try (nothing, error, crash?)
4. Which browser you're using
5. Desktop or mobile?

I can add more debug logging to track down the exact issue.
