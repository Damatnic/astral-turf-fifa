## ✨ Key Improvements This Session

### Mobile-First Design Patterns
Both TrainingPage and TransfersPage now follow mobile-first principles:
- Content flows naturally on small screens
- Touch targets exceed minimum 44px
- Grids adapt: 1 column → 2 columns → 3 columns
- Buttons stack vertically on mobile, inline on desktop
- Cards expand to full width on mobile

### Consistency
All pages now use the same components:
- `ResponsivePage` for page wrapper
- `ResponsiveGrid` for adaptive layouts
- `TouchButton` for all actions
- `ResponsiveCard` for content containers

### User Experience
- Faster navigation with larger touch targets
- Clearer visual hierarchy on small screens
- Reduced scrolling with adaptive grids
- Consistent interaction patterns across pages
