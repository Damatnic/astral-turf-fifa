## 🎓 What We Learned

### Problem
User completed "8 phases" of work creating extensive documentation (~10,000+ lines) but saw ZERO changes in the deployed application because components were never actually integrated.

### Solution
1. Diagnosed the issue: Components existed but weren't imported/used
2. Created real working components (not just docs)
3. Integrated into actual running application
4. Fixed build issues (react-window compatibility)
5. Added all remaining features
6. Tested and deployed

### Key Takeaways
- ✅ Documentation is good, but integration is essential
- ✅ Components must be actually used, not just created
- ✅ Build compatibility matters (react-window issue)
- ✅ Incremental integration is better than big-bang
- ✅ Testing after each change prevents regressions
- ✅ User feedback drives priorities
