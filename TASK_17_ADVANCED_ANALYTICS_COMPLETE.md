## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Session Recording
```typescript
import { sessionRecorder } from '@/services/sessionRecorder';

// Start recording
sessionRecorder.startRecording();

// Record events
sessionRecorder.recordEvent('player_move', 'tactical', {
  playerId: 'p1',
  x: 50,
  y: 30
});

sessionRecorder.recordEvent('formation_change', 'tactical', {
  formation: '4-3-3'
});

// Stop and get summary
const summary = sessionRecorder.stopRecording();
console.log(summary); // totalEvents, eventsByType, etc.
```

### Heatmap Generation
```typescript
import { heatmapAnalytics } from '@/services/heatmapAnalytics';

// Record player positions
heatmapAnalytics.recordPosition('p1', 50, 30, 1.0);
heatmapAnalytics.recordPosition('p1', 52, 32, 1.0);
heatmapAnalytics.recordPosition('p1', 55, 35, 1.0);

// Generate heatmap
const heatmap = heatmapAnalytics.generatePlayerHeatmap('p1');
// Returns: array of {x, y, intensity} points

// Analyze movement
const patterns = heatmapAnalytics.analyzeMovementPatterns('p1', 'Player 1');
// Returns: array of {from, to, frequency, avgSpeed, distance}

// Zone coverage
const coverage = heatmapAnalytics.analyzeZoneCoverage();
// Returns: array of {zone, coverage%, players, dominant, avgIntensity}
```

### Dashboard Usage
```typescript
import SessionRecordingDashboard from '@/components/dashboards/SessionRecordingDashboard';

function MyPage() {
  const playerPositions = [
    { playerId: 'p1', playerName: 'Player 1', x: 50, y: 30 },
    // ... more players
  ];

  return (
    <SessionRecordingDashboard
      playerPositions={playerPositions}
      className="mt-6"
    />
  );
}
```
