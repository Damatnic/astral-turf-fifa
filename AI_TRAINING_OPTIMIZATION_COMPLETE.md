## 🎓 Key Algorithms

### **Age Factor Calculation**
```
< 18:  +30% (rapid youth development)
19-23: +40% (peak development years)
24-27: +20% (continued growth)
28-30:   0% (maintenance phase)
> 30:  -20% (natural decline)
```

### **Training Effectiveness**
```
Total Multiplier = 1 + AgeFactor + PotentialFactor + CoachBonus + FacilityBonus

Attribute Gain = BaseGain × Intensity × TotalMultiplier × RandomVariation
  where:
    BaseGain = 0.15
    Intensity = 1.5 (high) | 1.0 (medium) | 0.5 (low)
    RandomVariation = 0.8 to 1.2
```

### **Priority Scoring**
```
Priority = HIGH if:
  - Age < 23 AND PotentialGap > 10
  - Age < 26 AND PotentialGap > 5
  
Priority = MEDIUM if:
  - PotentialGap > 8 (any age)
  
Priority = LOW otherwise
```
