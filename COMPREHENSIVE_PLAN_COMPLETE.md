## 🎨 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Building on the **Tactics Board UX Overhaul success**, this plan applies the same quality standards to every page:

### What Worked on Tactics Board (Replicate Everywhere)

✅ **Visual Clarity**
- High contrast (dropdowns opaque, not transparent)
- Proper z-index layering (no overlapping)
- Clear visual hierarchy

✅ **Intuitive Interactions**
- Natural drag-and-drop (ghost preview, color feedback)
- Instant actions (no confirmation dialogs unless destructive)
- Smooth animations (60fps, Framer Motion)

✅ **Responsive Design**
- View mode toggles (grid/list/compact)
- Adapts seamlessly to screen size
- Touch-optimized for mobile

✅ **User Feedback**
- Visual indicators for all states
- Color-coded feedback (green/red/yellow)
- Informative empty states

✅ **Performance**
- GPU-accelerated animations
- Optimized renders (React.memo, useMemo)
- Fast load times (<2s)

**Result:** User satisfaction went from **1/5 → 5/5** on Tactics Board!

**Goal:** Achieve **5/5 satisfaction across ALL 39 pages** with this plan.
