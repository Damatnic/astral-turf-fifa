**Do a hard reload:** Press **Ctrl + Shift + R**

This is CRITICAL because service worker is caching old version!

### Step 2: Test Navigation
1. Click **Squad** → Should see dropdown
2. Click **Challenges** → Should see dropdown
3. Click any dropdown item → Should navigate

### Step 3: Verify UI
1. Check top-right corner
2. "Online" indicator should be **below** navbar
3. Not hidden behind it

### Step 4: Test Features
1. Go to `/tactics`
2. See 3 action buttons (blue, purple, green)
3. Click Formation Library
4. Select a formation
5. AI analysis should show
