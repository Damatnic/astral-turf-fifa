## üö® CRITICAL: CLEAR CACHE!

**The deployment is live, but cache is serving pages you've already visited!**

**For EACH page you visit:**
1. Press Ctrl + Shift + R
2. This forces that specific page to reload fresh

**Or:**
- Clear all site data (F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Clear)
- Then navigate around

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S ACTUALLY DEPLOYED

**All these ARE live:**
- ‚úÖ Navigation dropdowns (desktop)
- ‚úÖ Formation Library (3 buttons on /tactics)
- ‚úÖ AI Tactical Analysis
- ‚úÖ Analytics page (/tactics-analytics)
- ‚úÖ Heat maps
- ‚úÖ Ultimate Player Profile (/player/:id)
- ‚úÖ All 24 formations
- ‚úÖ Offline indicator fix

**You just need to clear cache to see them!**

---

**TRY THIS:**
1. Open Incognito window
2. Go to your Vercel URL
3. Navigate to /#/tactics
4. Look for 3 buttons top-right
5. They WILL be there in incognito!

This proves the deployment is live - just cache is the issue!
