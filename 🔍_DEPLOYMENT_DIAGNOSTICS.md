## üß™ SPECIFIC ISSUES TO CHECK

### Which Pages Are Not Working?

Please specify which pages have errors:
- [ ] Landing page (/)
- [ ] Login (/login)
- [ ] Dashboard (/dashboard)
- [ ] Tactics board (/tactics)
- [ ] Analytics (/tactics-analytics)

2. **404 errors?**
3. **Component not found?**
4. **TypeScript errors in console?**
5. **Network errors?**
6. **Authentication issues?**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è COMMON DEPLOYMENT ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue 1: Routes Return 404
**Symptom:** Direct navigation to routes fails  
**Cause:** SPA routing not configured  
**Fix:** Ensure `vercel.json` has rewrites

### Issue 2: Components Fail to Load
**Symptom:** "Failed to lazy load component"  
**Cause:** Incorrect chunk splitting  
**Fix:** Check dynamic imports

### Issue 3: Environment Variables Missing
**Symptom:** API calls fail, features broken  
**Cause:** Vercel env vars not set  
**Fix:** Configure in Vercel dashboard

### Issue 4: Build Cache Issues
**Symptom:** Old version showing  
**Cause:** Vercel serving cached build  
**Fix:** Force redeploy or clear cache

---

## üîß IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSTIC STEPS

### Step 1: Check Vercel Dashboard
- Is build successful?
- Are there any build errors?
- What's the deployment status?

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Look for RED errors (not warnings)
- Note which component/file is failing

### Step 3: Check Network Tab
- Go to Network tab
- Look for 404s or 500s
- Check which resources failed

### Step 4: Test Specific Routes
- `/` - Should load landing
- `/login` - Should show login
- `/tactics` - Should show tactics board
- `/tactics-analytics` - Should show analytics

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

**Please provide:**
1. **Specific pages that don't work**
2. **Actual error messages from console** (RED errors only)
3. **Screenshots** if possible
4. **Which features are broken**

Then I can:
- Identify root cause
- Fix specific issues
- Redeploy with fixes
- Verify functionality

## üí° LIKELY CAUSES

Based on deployment patterns, common issues are:

### 1. Environment Variables Not Set
**What:** Vercel deployment missing env vars  
**Fix:** Set in Vercel dashboard  
**Priority:** HIGH if API features failing

### 2. Route Configuration
**What:** Direct route access returns 404  
**Fix:** Update `vercel.json` rewrites  
**Priority:** HIGH if navigation broken

### 3. Lazy Loading Failures
**What:** Dynamic imports not resolving  
**Fix:** Check import paths  
**Priority:** MEDIUM if specific components fail

### 4. Build Optimization Issues
**What:** Large chunks causing load issues  
**Fix:** Code splitting optimization  
**Priority:** LOW (performance, not functionality)

## üö® CRITICAL QUESTION

**Can you tell me:**
1. **What page are you on when you see errors?**
