## Critical 🔴 (Blockers & runtime failures)

- **Auth context contract is broken**
  - `AppProvider` wraps children with `<AuthContext.Provider value={{ authState: state.auth, dispatch }}>` (`src/context/AppProvider.tsx`, lines ~150–200).
  - The new `AuthContext` definition (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`) exposes `{ state, login, logout, updateState }` and no `dispatch`/`authState` fields.
  - Consumers (e.g. `DashboardPage.tsx`, `ProtectedRoute.tsx`, `LoginPage.tsx`) still destructure `{ authState, dispatch }` and expect reducer actions. This will either crash or type-error everywhere the app touches auth.
  - **Action:** Decide on a single auth paradigm (reducer vs. provider-managed state), refactor both provider and hook accordingly, and update all consumers + tests.

- **Reducer/provider shape drift across other contexts**
  - Similar drift is emerging in Franchise/UI contexts—pages rely on `dispatch` and deep reducer actions while several providers have been partially rewritten.
  - **Action:** Audit every context (`FranchiseContext`, `TacticsContext`, `UIContext`, `ChallengeContext`) to confirm exposed value shape matches consumer usage before making further UI changes.

- **Navigation & routing rely on invalid auth state**
  - `App.tsx` checks `authState.isAuthenticated`, but with the broken context this flag never initializes.
  - Protected pages may become unreachable even after login, blocking the entire experience.

- **Temp originals still shipped**
  - The `temp_original/` tree contains older pages/components with translucent styling, outdated context usage, and variable-based themes.
  - These files shadow the main implementation in several imports and confuse grep/maintenance (hundreds of stale classnames).
  - **Action:** Either remove `temp_original/` from the bundle or clearly archive it outside `src/`; make sure no build/import path points to it.

## High Priority 🟠 (Major UX / feature gaps)

- **Transparency/theming refactor unfinished outside navigation**
  - Over 200 matches for `bg-*/20`, `/50`, etc. still exist in live components (`src/pages/FinancesPage.tsx`, `src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`, `src/components/popups/*`, `src/components/tactics/*`, `src/utils/virtualizationOptimizations.tsx`, etc.).
  - Tests (`src/__tests__/components/tactics/*.test.tsx`) still assert old translucent classnames.
  - **Action:** Replace remaining semi-transparent utilities with solid palettes, align tests to the new classnames, and watch for opacity suffixes in utilities (`hover:bg-slate-700/30`, `bg-black/60`).

- **Auth service still demo-only**
  - `authService.login` delegates to `secureAuthService` but all data originates from `DEMO_USERS` and localStorage tokens.
  - No API wiring exists for real authentication, yet UI flows (Login/Signup/Settings) assume production behavior.
  - **Action:** Document interface needed for real backend; implement or stub HTTP layer so UI doesn’t silently fall back to mock state.

- **State persistence inconsistency**
  - `AppProvider` persists reducer state to localStorage, but critical UI fields are stripped via `cleanStateForSaving`. Several newer fields (AI chat, analytics, etc.) were not added to the transient key list, causing possible serialization errors.
  - **Action:** Revisit persistence logic once reducer shapes are settled to avoid data loss or JSON parse failures.

- **Testing drift**
  - Jest suites still expect legacy classes/structure (see `src/__tests__/ux-enhancements.test.tsx`, `ConflictResolutionMenu.test.tsx`), so running tests after the theming refactor will fail.
  - **Action:** Update snapshots/queries to target semantic roles or updated classnames after the UI audit is complete.

---

## Medium Priority 🟡 (Important polish & completeness)

### Code Quality & Technical Debt

- **Console statements littering production code**
  - 50+ `console.log`/`console.error`/`console.warn` calls exist in frontend code.
  - Backend has proper logging service but frontend mixes console statements with logging service.
  - **Files:** `src/services/apiService.ts`, `src/components/ui/menus/FileMenu.tsx`, `temp_original/` tree
  - **Action:** Replace all console statements with proper `loggingService` calls; configure log levels for dev/prod environments.

- **TODO/FIXME comments require resolution**
  - 100+ TODO/FIXME/HACK comments scattered across codebase.
  - Notable items:
    - `src/backend/api/PhoenixAPIServer.ts`: GraphQL temporarily disabled (line 32, 938)
    - `src/backend/api/PhoenixAPIServer.ts`: Email service integration needed (line 5078)
    - `src/backend/services/SessionService.ts`: GeoIP service integration (line 485)
    - `src/hooks/useTacticalPresets.ts`: Cloud sync implementation (lines 428, 458)
    - `src/components/tactics/mobile/MobileTacticsBoardContainer.tsx`: Touch gesture wiring (lines 73, 84)
    - `src/examples/MobileIntegrationExamples.tsx`: Missing components or file removal needed (line 15)
    - `src/utils/performanceMonitor.ts`: Analytics service integration (line 251)
  - **Action:** Create GitHub issues for each TODO; implement or remove placeholders.

- **CSS !important overrides**
  - 20+ `!important` declarations in `src/styles/responsive.css` indicate specificity issues.
  - **Action:** Refactor CSS to eliminate need for `!important`; use Tailwind layers and proper selector specificity.

- **Debug/development code left in production**
  - `src/services/apiService.ts`: `__debugTimeoutCount` and `__debugTimeoutValues` properties (lines 230-231)
  - `src/performance/MemoizedComponents.tsx`: `createDebugMemo` with console logging (line 214)
  - `src/components/mobile/MobilePlayerToken.tsx`: Performance overlay for debugging (line 360)
  - **Action:** Guard debug code behind `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` or remove entirely.

### Architecture & Organization

- **Layout & theme tokens**
  - `ResponsivePage`, layout wrappers, and many components mix Tailwind utilities with CSS custom properties (`var(--bg-primary)`), undermining the new solid color system.
  - **Action:** Normalize theme tokens (decide on CSS variables vs. Tailwind enums) to prevent regression during further styling work.

- **Routing & bundle organization**
  - `App.tsx` resides at the repo root and imports `./src/...`, deviating from Vite defaults and making tooling brittle.
  - **Action:** Move `App.tsx` into `src/` (or adjust Vite config) to align with expected structure before future upgrades.

- **Mock-heavy feature pages**
  - Pages like `FinancesPage.tsx`, `TrainingPage.tsx`, `TransfersPage.tsx`, and `AnalyticsPage.tsx` rely entirely on reducer state seeded from constants. There is no data fetching or backend integration.
  - **Action:** Document API contracts or connect to backend services; otherwise mark clearly as demo-only to set user expectations.

- **PWA/offline components**
  - `PWAInstallPrompt`, `OfflineIndicator`, and service worker registration exist but have not been tested since the Vite dev workflow was stabilized.
  - **Action:** Validate install/update flows in production mode (service worker enabled) and ensure update prompts match new design guidelines.

### Backend Integration Gaps

- **Email service not implemented**
  - `PhoenixAPIServer.ts` has placeholders for email verification, password reset, and welcome emails.
  - **Files:** `src/backend/api/PhoenixAPIServer.ts` (lines 5078-5084), `backend/src/auth/auth.service.ts` (lines 97, 240, 290)

- **GraphQL endpoint disabled**
  - GraphQL functionality commented out due to Prisma schema mismatches.
  - **Files:** `src/backend/api/PhoenixAPIServer.ts` (lines 32, 938)
  - **Action:** Resolve Prisma schema conflicts; re-enable and test GraphQL queries/mutations.

- **GeoIP location service missing**
  - Session service has placeholder for IP geolocation.
  - **Files:** `src/backend/services/SessionService.ts` (line 485)
  - **Action:** Integrate MaxMind, IP2Location, or similar GeoIP service for session tracking.

### Feature Completeness

- **Cloud sync for tactical presets not implemented**
  - Tactical presets hook has TODO comments for cloud synchronization.
  - **Files:** `src/hooks/useTacticalPresets.ts` (lines 428, 458)
  - **Action:** Implement backend API endpoints for sync; add conflict resolution logic.

- **Touch gesture controller incomplete**
  - Mobile tactics board container has unconnected gesture handling.
  - **Files:** `src/components/tactics/mobile/MobileTacticsBoardContainer.tsx` (lines 73, 84)
  - **Action:** Wire pinch-zoom and pan handlers to TouchGestureController; test on physical devices.

- **Missing mobile components**
  - `MobileIntegrationExamples.tsx` references components that may not exist.
  - **Files:** `src/examples/MobileIntegrationExamples.tsx` (line 15)
  - **Action:** Implement missing components or remove example file entirely.
