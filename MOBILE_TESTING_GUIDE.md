node scripts/mobile-performance-check.js

# Check bundle size only
npm run analyze:bundle

# Run Lighthouse manually
npx lighthouse http://localhost:8081 \
  --emulated-form-factor=mobile \
  --preset=desktop \
  --view
```

**Performance Thresholds:**
- Touch latency: <100ms

## Performance Validation

### 1. Touch Latency Test

**Manual Test:**

2. Tap a button rapidly 10 times
3. Measure time from tap to visual response

**Expected:** <100ms per interaction

**Automated Test:**
```typescript
// In Playwright test
const startTime = Date.now();
await button.tap();
await page.waitForTimeout(100);
const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;
expect(responseTime).toBeLessThan(150);
```

### 2. Animation Frame Rate Test

**Manual Test:**
1. Perform rapid interactions (button taps, scrolling)
2. Observe for jank or stuttering
3. Use browser DevTools Performance tab

**Expected:** Consistent 60fps, no dropped frames

**Chrome DevTools:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Performance tab → Record
3. Perform interactions
4. Stop recording → Check FPS graph

### 3. Lighthouse Mobile Audit

**Run Audit:**
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run vite:dev

# Run Lighthouse (in another terminal)
npx lighthouse http://localhost:8081 \
  --emulated-form-factor=mobile \
  --throttling.cpuSlowdownMultiplier=4 \
  --view
```

**Target Scores:**
- Performance: ≥90
- Accessibility: ≥95
- Best Practices: ≥90
- SEO: ≥90

### 4. Memory Usage Test

**Browser DevTools Memory Test:**
1. Open DevTools → Memory tab
2. Take heap snapshot (baseline)
3. Navigate through all 7 pages
4. Return to original page
5. Take another heap snapshot
6. Compare memory delta

**Expected:** Memory increase <50MB, no memory leaks

## Known Issues

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)

1. **Linting Warnings**
   - Unused imports in AnalyticsPage and FinancesPage
   - Can be cleaned up in final polish
   - Does not affect functionality

2. **TypeScript 'any' Types**
   - Some calculations in AnalyticsPage use 'any'
   - Should be typed properly in production
   - Non-critical for responsive functionality

3. **Lighthouse Score Variability**
   - Scores may vary ±5 points between runs
   - Network conditions affect results
   - Run multiple times for accurate average

### Resolved Issues

- ✅ Missing JSX closing tags (Session 6) - **FIXED**
- ✅ ResponsiveGrid not closing properly - **FIXED**
- ✅ ResponsivePage wrapper missing on some pages - **FIXED**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dev Server Won't Start

**Problem:** Port 8081 already in use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check what's using the port
netstat -ano | findstr :8081

# Kill the process (Windows)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or use a different port
vite --port 8082
```

### Mobile Device Can't Access Dev Server

**Problem:** Can't access `http://192.168.x.x:8081`

**Solution:**
1. Check firewall allows port 8081
2. Make sure device is on same WiFi network
3. Verify your local IP: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux)
4. Try `http://localhost:8081` if testing in browser simulator

### Touch Targets Not Working

**Problem:** Buttons don't respond to taps on mobile

**Solution:**
1. Check button has `onClick` handler
2. Verify button is not disabled
3. Check z-index - another element might be overlapping
4. Test with `pointer-events: auto` CSS
5. Verify touch events aren't being prevented

### Responsive Grid Not Adapting

**Problem:** Grid stays in same column count

**Solution:**
1. Check breakpoint values in ResponsiveGrid props
2. Verify Tailwind CSS classes are generated
3. Check browser viewport width
4. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. Verify `useResponsive` hook is working

### Lighthouse Scores Low

**Problem:** Performance score below 90

**Common Causes:**
1. Images not optimized → Use WebP, lazy loading
2. Bundle size too large → Code splitting, tree shaking
3. Render-blocking resources → Defer non-critical JS/CSS
4. Slow server response → Optimize backend, use CDN
5. Third-party scripts → Audit and remove unnecessary scripts

**Solution:**
```bash
# Analyze bundle
npm run analyze:bundle

# Check bundle size
npm run build
# Check dist/ folder sizes

# Optimize images
# Use tools like imagemin, squoosh
```

### Memory Leaks

**Problem:** Memory usage increases over time

**Solution:**
1. Check for event listeners not being cleaned up
2. Use `useEffect` cleanup functions
3. Clear intervals/timeouts
4. Profile with Chrome DevTools Memory tab
5. Look for detached DOM nodes

### Tests Failing

**Problem:** Playwright tests fail intermittently

**Solution:**
1. Increase timeout: `test.setTimeout(60000)`
2. Add explicit waits: `await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')`
3. Check for race conditions
4. Verify selectors are stable
5. Run tests individually to isolate failures
