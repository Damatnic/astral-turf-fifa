/**
 * Mobile Integration Example
 * Demonstrates how to integrate mobile responsiveness into existing components
 *
 * ⚠️  TEMPORARILY DISABLED - TypeScript Errors ⚠️
 * This file has been commented out to reduce build errors.
 *
 * Issues to fix before re-enabling:
 * 1. Import path casing: '@/components/layout' should be '@/components/Layout'
 * 2. Missing component exports: ResponsiveContainer, ResponsiveGrid, ResponsiveModal, TouchButton
 * 3. Component prop mismatches: MobileHeader.showBackButton, MobileFAB.label
 * 4. Hook return type issues: usePinchGesture doesn't return 'handlers'
 * 5. Type safety issues with gesture types
 *
 * TODO: Either implement missing components OR remove this example file entirely
 * Status: Example/Demo code - NOT used in production
 *
 * Original file backed up as: MobileIntegrationExamples.tsx.bak
