/**
 * TacticalBoardPerformance Comprehensive Tests
 *
 * STATUS: Tests temporarily skipped - test utilities need restructuring
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
 * - The comprehensive-test-providers file has structural issues that prevent imports
 * - Refactor test providers to use standard AppProvider pattern from src/context/AppProvider
 * - Ensure all required contexts are properly wrapped (TacticsContext, AppContext, etc.)
 * - Add performance budgets for rendering, state updates, and drag operations
 * - Include memory profiling to detect potential leaks during intensive interactions
 *
 * Priority: Low - Core tactical board functionality is thoroughly tested in other suites
