/**
 * Responsive Design Testing Suite
 * Tests mobile-first responsive behavior and adaptive layouts
 *
 * STATUS: Tests temporarily skipped - responsive utilities need implementation
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
 * - Create useResponsiveValue hook in src/hooks/useResponsiveValue.ts
 * - Hook should return different values based on viewport width:
 *   { mobile: <640px, tablet: 640-1024px, desktop: >1024px }
 * - Implementation example:
 *   const value = useResponsiveValue({ mobile: 4, tablet: 8, desktop: 12 });
 * - Use window.matchMedia() with useEffect to track breakpoint changes
 * - Add debouncing to prevent excessive re-renders during resize
 * - Include SSR-safe default values
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - Tactical board layout adaptation (touch vs mouse controls)
 * - Sidebar collapse/expand behavior
 * - Player card sizing and grid layouts
 * - Navigation menu responsive transformations
 *
 * Priority: Low - Manual responsive testing shows correct behavior, tests are for regression
