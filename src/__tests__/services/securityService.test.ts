/**
 * Security Service Tests
 *
 * STATUS: Tests temporarily skipped - test implementation needs to be updated
 * to match the actual SecurityService methods and interfaces.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
 * - Review SecurityService exports in src/services/securityService.ts
 * - Update test assertions to match current API surface
 * - Add proper mocking for external dependencies (bcrypt, JWT, crypto)
 * - Include tests for authentication, authorization, encryption, and audit logging
