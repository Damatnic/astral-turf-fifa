  lighthouse: {
    performance: 90,
    accessibility: 95,
    bestPractices: 90,
    seo: 90,
  },
  bundleSize: {
    total: 500 * 1024, // 500KB
    responsive: 50 * 1024, // 50KB
  },
  memoryUsage: 50 * 1024 * 1024, // 50MB
};
```

## 🐛 Issues Identified from Test Run

### Issue 1: Missing MobileAppLayout Import ❌

**Error:**
```
Failed to resolve import "./Layout/MobileAppLayout" from "src/components/Layout.tsx". 
Does the file exist?
```

**Impact:** Critical - blocks all pages from loading

**Root Cause:** Layout.tsx references MobileAppLayout component that doesn't exist

**Fix Required:** Either:
1. Create MobileAppLayout.tsx component, OR
2. Remove the import if not needed

**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH (blocking)

### Issue 2: Grid Selector Not Finding Tailwind Classes ❌

**Error:**
```
expect(received).toBeGreaterThan(expected)
Expected: > 0
Received: 0
```

**Test Line:**
```typescript
const grids = await page.locator('[class*="grid"]').all();
expect(grids.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
```

**Impact:** Medium - test validation issue, not functional issue

**Root Cause:** Tailwind's `grid` class may be compiled differently or elements use different class naming

**Fix Required:** Update selector to match actual rendered classes:
```typescript
// Better selector
const grids = await page.locator('.grid, [class*="ResponsiveGrid"]').all();
```

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM (test refinement)

### Issue 3: Touch Latency Higher Than Expected ❌

**Error:**
```
expect(received).toBeLessThan(expected)
Expected: < 150ms
Received: 806ms
```

**Impact:** Low - performance optimization needed

**Root Cause:** 
- First tap may include page initialization time
- Dev server may be slower than production
- Need to warm up before measuring

**Fix Required:** 
1. Add warm-up taps before measuring
2. Test on production build
3. Measure multiple taps and average

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW (optimization)

### Issue 4: Tactics Board Element Not Found ❌

**Error:**
```
expect(locator).toBeVisible() failed
Locator: locator('[class*="tactical"], [class*="board"]').first()
Expected: visible
Received: <element(s) not found>
```

**Impact:** Medium - specific test needs adjustment

**Root Cause:** Page redirects to login, or element uses different class names

**Fix Required:** Update selector or add authentication

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM (test adjustment)

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Went Well ✅

1. **Playwright Integration Perfect:** Test suite structure is solid, device emulation working flawlessly
2. **Test Failures Are GOOD:** We're catching real integration issues before manual testing
3. **Comprehensive Coverage:** 21 tests covering all critical mobile scenarios
4. **Documentation Quality:** 600+ line testing guide will save hours of manual testing
5. **Performance Focus:** Built-in latency and load time validation

### Challenges Encountered 🤔

1. **Test.use() Issue:** Had to restructure tests to work with Playwright's device configuration
2. **Selector Specificity:** Tailwind's utility-first approach makes generic selectors harder
3. **Dev Server Speed:** Touch latency tests affected by development server performance
4. **Missing Component:** MobileAppLayout import issue wasn't caught until test execution

### Lessons Learned 📚

1. **Test Early, Test Often:** Running tests immediately identified integration issues
2. **Playwright Projects:** Use playwright.config.ts for device configuration, not test.use()
3. **Selector Strategies:** Need specific selectors for utility-first CSS frameworks
4. **Warm-Up Required:** Performance tests need warm-up period for accurate measurements
5. **Screenshots Invaluable:** Playwright's failure screenshots immediately show what's wrong
