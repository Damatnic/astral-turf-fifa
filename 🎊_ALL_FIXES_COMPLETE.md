## ✅ WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED

### **1. Player Data Issue - FIXED** ✅

**Problem:** "player data error on tactics board"

**Root Causes:**
1. ❌ `astralTurfActiveState` not saved on first visit
2. ❌ PositioningSystem looked for `fieldPosition` but players had `position`

**Fixes:**
- ✅ AppProvider saves INITIAL_STATE immediately if missing
- ✅ PositioningSystem uses `player.fieldPosition || player.position`
- ✅ 15 default players now always load
- ✅ Players visible on tactics board

**Commits:**
- `4bd2e02` - Save initial state fix
- `703f232` - Position property fallback
- `e76342b` - Null safety improvements

---

### **2. Service Worker Cache - FIXED** ✅

**Problem:** Users stuck on old v1/v2 cache

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Bumped to v3 to invalidate old caches
- ✅ Force `skipWaiting()` on install
- ✅ Aggressive SW registration (unregister old before new)
- ✅ Delete all old caches before v3 registration
- ✅ `updateViaCache: 'none'` - never cache SW file
- ✅ Check for updates every 3 seconds
- ✅ Auto-reload when new SW activates

**Commits:**
- `89a9b8b` - Nuclear cache fix + SW v3
