## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Demo Account Data Structure ✅
**Problem:** `DEMO_PLAYER_PROFILE` had incorrect/missing properties  
**Solution:** Completely restructured to match `PlayerRankingProfile` interface

```typescript
// ADDED:
- earnedAttributes: { pace, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending, physical }
- weeklyProgress: { weekNumber, xpEarned, dailyActivity, weeklyGoals }
- monthlyStats: { totalXP, challengesCompleted, categoryBreakdown }
- totalStats: { difficultyBreakdown, categoryBreakdown, completionRate }
- Badge categories: achievement, milestone, special, seasonal
- createdAt/updatedAt timestamps

// FIXED:
- challengesInProgress → challengesActive
- Removed skillPoints (not in interface)
- lastActiveDate → lastCompletionDate
```

### 2. Logout State Cleanup ✅
**Problem:** Logout wasn't clearing app state, allowing data leakage between accounts  
**Solution:** Added state cleanup to authService.logout()

```typescript
// ADDED to logout():
localStorage.removeItem('astralTurfActiveState');
localStorage.removeItem('astral-turf-player-profiles');
```

### 3. Navigation Dropdowns ✅
**Problem:** Squad & Challenges parent items weren't clickable on desktop  
**Solution:** Made parent items open dropdowns on click, navigate to first child

### 4. Offline Indicator Z-Index ✅
**Problem:** "Back Online" indicator appeared behind navbar  
**Solution:** Increased z-index from `z-40` to `z-[60]` and adjusted position to `top-20`

### 5. Service Worker Cache ✅
**Problem:** Old cached files prevented new code from loading  
**Solution:** 
- Bumped cache version to v3
- Added `skipWaiting()` for immediate activation
- Created aggressive update check in `sw-register.js`
- Created nuclear cache clear page

### 6. Player Data Loading ✅
**Problem:** Players not loading on tactics board after cache clear  
**Solution:** Modified `AppProvider` to immediately save `INITIAL_STATE` to localStorage if not found

### 7. Player Position Fallback ✅
**Problem:** `PositioningSystem` only checked `fieldPosition`, but default players had `position`  
**Solution:** Added fallback: `const pos = player.fieldPosition || player.position;`
