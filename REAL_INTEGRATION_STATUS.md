   - Current formation name

3. **Left Sidebar**: RosterGrid showing all players
   - List view by default
   - Toggle to grid view
   - Click to select players

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Still Using OLD Components In Some Places:
1. **UnifiedTacticsBoard.tsx** - The 1,805-line monster is STILL imported by old TacticsBoardPage
2. **Header.tsx** - Old header still used on non-tactics pages
3. **LeftSidebar** - Old player sidebar still in UnifiedTacticsBoard

### Build Issue:
- RosterGrid had virtual scrolling with `react-window` library causing build errors
- Restored original version (works but needs testing)

### Not Yet Functional:
- Undo/Redo (needs history state integration)
- Player dragging on field (handlers ready, needs backend)
- Formation save/load (localStorage ready, needs UI)
- Player comparison view
- AI assist features

## üöÄ What Needs to Happen Next

### PRIORITY 1: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel build
# Then check: https://your-vercel-url.com/tactics
# Expected: New toolbar and navbar visible
```

### PRIORITY 2: Fix Remaining Integration
1. **Remove old TacticsBoardPage import** from App.tsx (cleanup)
2. **Test player interactions** on deployed site
3. **Fix RosterGrid** if virtual scrolling needed (or keep simple version)
4. **Wire up Undo/Redo** to actual history state
5. **Connect player dragging** to formation updates

### PRIORITY 3: Polish & Complete
1. Save/Load formation UI dialogs
2. Player comparison modal
3. Export formatting options
4. Keyboard shortcuts
5. Mobile responsiveness

## üí° REALITY CHECK

**We spent 8 phases building documentation and some components, but NEVER integrated them into the running app until NOW.**

**Today's Work**: Actually wired up the new components so you can SEE them in the deployed application.

**Result**: Visit `/tactics` and you'll finally see the new toolbar and navbar (not just old UI).

---

## üìù Next Session Focus

1. **Test the deployed site** - verify toolbar and navbar appear
2. **Fix any visual/functional issues** found
3. **Complete player interaction** (click, drag, select)
4. **Add missing modals** (Save, Load, Comparison)
5. **Performance testing** with real data
