---

## 🧪 Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests (Recommended)
```typescript
// Test rarity config calculation
test('getRarityConfig returns correct config for legendary', () => {
  expect(config.particles).toBe(12);
  expect(config.shimmer).toBe(true);
});

// Test stat comparison logic
test('identifies best performer correctly', () => {
  expect(findBestAttribute(players)).toBe(player1);
});
```

### Integration Tests
```typescript
// Test export functionality
test('exports card as PNG successfully', async () => {
  const result = await exportPlayerCard(cardElement);
  expect(result.success).toBe(true);
  expect(result.dataUrl).toContain('data:image/png');
});
```

### Visual Regression Tests
- Capture screenshots of each rarity tier
- Compare against baseline images
- Detect unintended visual changes

type CardRarity = 'common' | 'uncommon' | 'rare' | 'epic' | 'legendary';
```

### Known Issues:
- Minor TypeScript warnings for `weeklyXP` property (not in current PlayerRankingProfile type)
- ESLint warnings for array index keys (cosmetic, non-blocking)
- html2canvas may have CORS issues with external images

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. Add `weeklyXP` to PlayerRankingProfile type definition
2. Integrate cards into main player ranking UI
3. Add export analytics tracking
4. Create card templates for different player types
5. Implement card collection/gallery view
