test('applyFilters should recursively filter nested data')
test('buildTimeRangeFilter should handle all timeRange values')

// File storage
test('saveReportToStorage should create directories and save files')
test('saveReportToStorage should generate unique filenames')

// Real-time streaming
test('getRealtimeEvents should establish SSE connection')
test('getRealtimeEvents should filter events by type')
test('getRealtimeEvents should cleanup on disconnect')

// Cron scheduling
test('calculateNextCronRun should handle common patterns')
test('scheduleReport should save schedule to appState')

// ML/AI predictions
test('predictInjuries should calculate risk scores')
test('recommendFormation should rank formations by effectiveness')
```

### Integration Tests Needed

test('User can schedule weekly reports')
test('User can stream real-time match events')

// Database integration
test('Reports are saved to storage directory')
test('Scheduled reports are stored in appState')
