## 🛠️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Frontend (Current + Additions)
**Keep:**
- React 18.3.1 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- Tauri (desktop)
- Vite 7.1.7

**Add:**
- React Query (server state)
- Zustand/Redux (global state)
- React Hook Form (forms)
- Zod (validation)
- Chart.js (visualizations)

### Backend (New - Recommended)
**Stack:**
- Node.js + NestJS
- PostgreSQL (database)
- Redis (sessions/cache)
- JWT (authentication)
- Socket.io (real-time)

**Database Schema:**
- `users` table (id, email, password_hash, role, metadata)
- `sessions` table (JWT refresh tokens)
- `family_permissions` table (guardian access control)
- `player_associations` table (family-player links)
- `audit_logs` table (security tracking)

### Authentication Flow
1. **Registration:** Role selection → Form → Email verification → Account active
2. **Login:** Credentials → JWT tokens (15min access, 7day refresh) → Dashboard redirect
3. **Protected Routes:** Role check → Permission check → Render or 403
4. **Token Refresh:** Access expires → Refresh endpoint → New token → Continue

5. **User Adoption** → User testing, onboarding flows, comprehensive guides

### Security Risks
6. **Auth Vulnerabilities** → Security audit, penetration testing, rate limiting, 2FA
